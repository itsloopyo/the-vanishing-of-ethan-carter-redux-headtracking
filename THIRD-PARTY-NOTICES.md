# Third-Party Notices

EthanCarterReduxHeadTracking bundles, statically links, or credits the third-party components
listed below. Each remains the property of its authors and is used under its own
licence. Where a licence requires the copyright notice, the conditions and the
disclaimer to accompany a binary distribution, the full text is reproduced here
verbatim, and this file ships at the root of every release ZIP we publish.

Nothing in this repository is derived from the code of The Vanishing of Ethan
Carter Redux, and no extracted game assets or data files are redistributed
here.

## Ultimate ASI Loader

Vendored at `vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/`, shipped in the installer ZIP and used as the
install-time source. Taken from the upstream release asset untouched; the
upstream licence file ships beside it at `vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/LICENSE`.

- **Version:** `v9.7.4`, commit `6b440669144c4a0bef5718ab155df160d231cd42`
- **License:** MIT
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader
- **Usage:** Loads `EthanCarterReduxHeadTracking.asi` into the game process; installed as `winmm.dll` in the game's Win64 directory.
- **Bundled:** yes. Bundled in release ZIP as the install-time source of truth; install.cmd never reaches the network for it.
- **SHA-256:** `fa266e3513d02c08a1b808f28c10538a489eaffaa4b0707f7cc1066e71b5afd7` (`dinput8.dll`)

```

That `dinput8.dll` is a static binary and is not one component. The
`Ultimate-ASI-Loader-x64` target in `premake5.lua` at v9.7.4 compiles
`external/injector/minhook/src/**.c`,
`external/injector/utility/FunctionHookMinHook.cpp` and `external/miniz/miniz.c`
alongside the loader's own sources, so redistributing it redistributes MinHook,
injector and miniz as well, and each has its own section in this file.
MemoryModule, d3d8to9 and the minidx9 DirectX headers belong to the 32-bit
target only and are absent from this binary. The MinHook section covers the copy
inside the loader as well as any linked into the mod itself; the licence text is
the same.

---

## injector

Compiled into the vendored `dinput8.dll`. The loader's `FunctionHookMinHook`
wrapper, which the `Ultimate-ASI-Loader-x64` target compiles from
`external/injector/utility/FunctionHookMinHook.cpp`, and the MinHook submodule
that repository carries. Nothing in this repository calls or links it; it ships
only inside that binary.

- **Version:** commit `3a384e8d1b575c09383b0fab8bd92e34cb654949`, the submodule
  Ultimate ASI Loader v9.7.4 pins at `external/injector/`
- **License:** Zlib
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/ThirteenAG/injector
- **Usage:** Not called by this repository; present only because the vendored loader binary was compiled with it.
- **Bundled:** yes. Ships in the release ZIP inside the vendored `dinput8.dll`, which install.cmd extracts without reaching the network.

The binary is unaltered upstream, so the "altered source versions" condition
below does not arise. It is reproduced whole regardless.

## miniz

Compiled into the vendored `dinput8.dll`. Zip reading for the loader's
`LoadVirtualFilesFromZip` path, which the `Ultimate-ASI-Loader-x64` target
compiles from `external/miniz/miniz.c`. Nothing in this repository calls or
links it; it ships only inside that binary.

- **Version:** 3.0.0, as vendored at `external/miniz/` in Ultimate ASI Loader v9.7.4
- **License:** MIT
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/richgel999/miniz
- **Usage:** Not called by this repository; present only because the vendored loader binary was compiled with it.
- **Bundled:** yes. Ships in the release ZIP inside the vendored `dinput8.dll`, which install.cmd extracts without reaching the network.

## MinHook

Fetched from upstream at configure time and compiled into `EthanCarterReduxHeadTracking.asi`.

- **Version:** `v1.3.3`, commit `9fbd087432700d73fc571118d6a9697a36443d88`
- **License:** BSD-2-Clause
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook
- **Usage:** Installs the trampoline on the player view point function the camera hook writes through.
- **Bundled:** yes. Statically linked into `EthanCarterReduxHeadTracking.asi`, which ships in the release ZIP.

MinHook carries two copyright holders: Tsuda Kageyu for MinHook itself, and
Vyacheslav Patkov for the Hacker Disassembler Engine under MinHook's own
`src/hde/`, which our build compiles alongside the rest of that library. Both
notices appear below exactly as upstream ships them.

## OpenTrack

- **Version:** n/a
- **License:** ISC
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack
- **Usage:** The UDP pose datagram layout this mod listens for on port 4242.
- **Bundled:** no. Protocol interoperability only; no OpenTrack code is linked or shipped.

Not bundled and not linked. This mod implements the OpenTrack UDP pose datagram
layout so that OpenTrack (https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack, ISC licence)
and compatible trackers can drive it. No OpenTrack code, headers or binaries
are copied, linked or redistributed, so its licence triggers no notice
obligation here. It is credited because the wire format is its work.
